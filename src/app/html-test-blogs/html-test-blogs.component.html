  <p>Home often means so much more than a roof and four walls. It’s the place where you raised your children, the place
    you made your own, the place you’ve decided to grow old in. You took the time to fill it with memories- but have you
    taken the time to make it safe? The world we live in today is unfortunately filled with burglars all too ready to
    take advantage of the homes you and your loved ones worked all your lives to own.</p>

    <p>These are exactly the kinds of questions Maria* had to ask herself when her father passed away, leaving her
      elderly mother Debra living alone in their family home. After a house in the neighborhood was broken into in late
      April, Maria began to fear for her mother’s safety and suggested she move in with family, but her mother was
      unwilling to leave the home that she had raised her children in. Maria and Debra’s search for security solutions
      led them to a big box store, where she had her mother pick out a screen door off the shelf. They waited weeks to
      get in contact with a general contractor so that they could get the door installed, only to find out that because
      of Debra’s extra tall entry way the door wouldn’t fit. Luckily for them, that is when they decided to call Mike’s
      Mobile.</p>

    <p>Security screen doors ultimately add an extra layer of protection to your home for you and your loved ones. A
      heavy duty security product, such as our <a href='https://mikesmobile.com/about/security-doors'><u>Titan or
          Viewguard</u></a> doors, offer maximum security, without sacrificing your homes curb appeal. Both of these
      doors are equipped to handle any deadbolt two-point locking system, and with the option to choose your hardware
      you can even have an electronic keypad lock installed with the door! Research shows that a coded locking system
      deters burglars, who might otherwise look for hidden spare keys or take advantage of the vulnerable moment where
      you are fumbling to find your key before opening the door.</p>
    <p>Beyond the lock itself, these screens are built to be both tough and smart security solutions. The Viewguard is
      equipped with MeshTec, the leader in security screening materials. MeshTec is a high-tensile stainless steel woven
      mesh, a USA made material that we offer with a life-time “never rust” warranty. Tensile systems help to ensure
      lasting durability. Tensile strength refers to the resistance of the material to breaking under tension. The more
      pressure and force applied to a MeshTec door screen, the tighter the screen locks into the frame. Picture a
      chinese finger trap toy, the harder you try to pull your fingers out, the tighter the toy becomes- the concept
      behind MeshTec technology is similar. MeshTec not only provides advanced security, the stainless steel mesh also
      lets in maximum airflow as compared with other security screening material.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<div class='col-md-12 text-center'>
  <p>The Titan on the other hand comes standard with a perforated aluminum screening material, which offers an extra
    layer of privacy, and can stop potentially unwanted house guests from peering into your home. Both doors feature
    marine-grade aluminium frames, which are warrantied for 10 years, so that you can be sure your family is receiving a
    quality product.</p>

<div class='col-md-12 text-center'>
  <p>When Maria called Mike’s Mobile on behalf of her mother, the customer service representative she talked to informed
    her about the showroom at our Sacramento location. After their experience at the big box store, Maria and Debra were
    thankful to be able to come see the front security screen door options in person, so they could determine if the
    products would actually be a good fit. Debra was instantly interested in the Viewguard, citing how surprised she was
    that the door was a security product, and noted that it really looks like just an upscale screen door. Do you
    remember the bars-on-the-windows, steel-trap, prison-like security products of yesterday? Debra certainly did, so
    she was shocked to see that Mike’s Mobile was carrying such sleek, stylish products.</p>
</div>
<div class='col-md-12 text-center'>
  <p>Even though her mother loved the look of the Viewguard, Maria’s main concerns were still focused on the security
    features. Like Maria you might be thinking: How secure can these products really be? Can you cut the screen? Could
    an animal get through the screen? There are so many questions to consider when trying to protect your family!
    Luckily a trained customer service representative was there to explain that with modern, top of line products, like
    the Viewguard, you no longer need to sacrifice style for security. It would take a power saw to cut through the
    screen, so it will certainly stand up to any rottweiler or angry cat who tries to tear at it. Just in case there was
    any doubt left in their minds, the customer service representative pulled up this <a
      href='https://www.facebook.com/MikesMobileScreenAndChimneyService/videos/1264548423571761/'><u>video</u></a> for
    Maria and Debra, which shows a manufacturer attempting to kick in a Viewguard door. After the manufacturers kick the
    door over and over again, without even creating a dent, they escalate to taking a sledgehammer to the screen- and
    the door still is not compromised.</p>
</div>
<div class='col-md-12 text-center'>
  <p>Maria and Debra were convinced but still wanted to make sure the fit of the door would be correct, considering that
    after the big box store fiasco they knew Debra’s entryway was not a standard size. They were set up with a free
    measurement appointment for just a couple days after they came into the showroom. When the Mike’s Mobile technician
    arrived they expected another “general contractor type” who would come take measurements and then quickly leave.
    They were, however, surprised again by the professional quality of Mike’s service. When they answered the door,
    Tyler gave them a warm and friendly greeting. As he got to work he explained to them his measuring process, so that
    they could better understand how the door would be mounted and how it would fit over Debra’s existing wood front
    door. He answered all of their questions and took time after measuring to make sure they knew all of their options.
    He even came prepared with swatches of the framing materials in various color samples, so that Maria and Debra could
    determine which color would maximize the curb appeal of the home.</p>
</div>
<div class='col-md-12 text-center'>
  <p>Ultimately Debra decided on the Viewguard door in Anodized Bronze. She was sold by the simple, classic design of
    the door, which she felt would add greatly to her home’s aesthetic appeal. Her daughter, Maria, was relieved by the
    fact that she no longer has to worry as much about her mother’s safety The heavy-duty stainless steel, aluminum
    frame, deadbolt lock, and hidden hardware all mean that her mother can let in the California cross breeze, even at
    night while she is sleeping, all while the home is more secure than ever! </p>

    <p>Only four weeks after Tyler first came out and met Maria and Debra for their measurement appointment, he came
      back to install their custom ordered door, so that he could personally ensure both women were satisfied with the
      fit, function, and design of the final product. Because Tyler was already familiar with their home and entryway
      the installation process was simple and seamless. Maria was so surprised by the quality of work that she swore
      never to settle for a company that uses random general contractors as installers ever again. </p>

    <p>The world today is, sadly, not always a safe place. It becomes more and more important everyday to take steps to
      protect yourself and your loved ones. Security products, especially on vulnerable entry points like front doors
      and windows, can help to fortify your home and guard you against unwanted visitors or threats to your family’s
      safety. One of the biggest concerns with a heavy-duty security product is that it might compromise the look of
      your home or come at the cost of your home’s curb appeal. With Mike’s Mobile’s top of the line, custom-fitted
      security screen doors you’ll never have to worry about sacrificing style for security ever again. Advanced

    <p>When it comes to protecting your client’s loved ones, Mike’s Mobile knows that goodwill is a ripple effect.
      Shortly after Debra’s Viewguard was installed, her close friend Kathy came to visit and instantly noticed the new
      security screen. She cited how she’d been looking for a similar product but since she lives in an independent
      housing retirement community she wasn’t sure where to start. Debra happily passed along a business card that Tyler
      had left with her when he finished her installation and thus another Mike’s Mobile customer was born. Before the
      end of the summer season four more senior citizens in Kathy’s living community were serviced by Mike’s Mobile.
      Kathy herself went forward with a Titan door in the “Folkstone” design and loves the character it adds to what she
      had previously considered a cookie cutter retirement home. The whole community seems to sleep a little safer and
      cooler thanks to the Mike's Mobile team.</p>
