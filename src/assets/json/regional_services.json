    "description": "At Mike's Mobile, we take pride in successfully solving your chimney needs in a cost effective and timely manner. Our goal is to make sure that your trust in us develops into a lifelong working relationship. From the office to the field, our employees have been trained by CSIA and NFI standards to give you superior customer service and high-quality workmanship. Chimney maintenance is important as chimneys vent hazardous gasses out of your home. Chimneys that are not annually swept and or inspected can potentially be a hazard to you, your family and your home. Maintaining the interior and exterior of your chimney will not only help protect you, your family and your home, but annual maintenance will aid in finding smaller problems before they develop into costly, more extensive repairs.",
