      "<div class='col-md-12 text-center'><p>Home often means so much more than a roof and four walls. It’s the place where you raised your children, the place you made your own, the place you’ve decided to grow old in. You took the time to fill it with memories- but have you taken the time to make it safe? The world we live in today is unfortunately filled with burglars all too ready to take advantage of the homes you and your loved ones worked all your lives to own.</p></div>",
      "<div class='col-md-12 text-center'><p>How do you keep your home safe from burglaries and break-ins? The answer often lies right at your front door. The FBI reports that a burglary occurs <a class='link' href='https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2017/crime-in-the-u.s.-2017/topic-pages/crime-clock'><u>every 22.6 seconds.</u></a> and roughly 34% of residential burglars enter right through the front door! Your front door is your first line of defense against theft and break-ins. Wouldn’t you want your front door to be as secure as possible? Do you have a front door with large, breakable glass panels? Or do you often open up your front door in the warmer months, to let that Californian cross breeze come in through your screen door? If you answered yes to any of these questions then it is probably time you considered a security screen door.</p></div>",
      "<div class='row'><div class='col-md-4 text-center'><img src='/assets/images/blogposts/03-20/viewGuard1.png' class='blog-img-fill'></div><div class='col-md-8 text-center'><p>These are exactly the kinds of questions Maria* had to ask herself when her father passed away, leaving her elderly mother Debra living alone in their family home. After a house in the neighborhood was broken into in late April, Maria began to fear for her mother’s safety and suggested she move in with family, but her mother was unwilling to leave the home that she had raised her children in. Maria and Debra’s search for security solutions led them to a big box store, where she had her mother pick out a screen door off the shelf. They waited weeks to get in contact with a general contractor so that they could get the door installed, only to find out that because of Debra’s extra tall entry way the door wouldn’t fit. Luckily for them, that is when they decided to call Den Defenders.</p></div></div>",
      "<div class='col-md-12 text-center'><a href='https://mikesmobile.com/'><u>Den Defenders</u></a> offers top of the line security screen products for you and your loved one’s homes. Every door we sell is custom ordered for your home, so that you never run into the roadblock that Maria and Debra came up against. Do you know the measurements for your front door? If not, it’s not a problem. Our team of technicians are trained to both measure for the doors and install them, and they are capable of modifying the doors to ensure a perfect fit, no matter the entryway. Here at Den Defenders we understand that the better the door fits, the better it functions.</div>",
      "<div class='row'><div class='col-md-4 text-center'><img src='/assets/images/blogposts/03-20/titanSecurityDoor.png' class='blog-img-fill'></div><div class='col-md-8 text-center'><p>Security screen doors ultimately add an extra layer of protection to your home for you and your loved ones. A heavy duty security product, such as our <a href='https://mikesmobile.com/about/security-doors'><u>Titan or Viewguard</u></a> doors, offer maximum security, without sacrificing your homes curb appeal. Both of these doors are equipped to handle any deadbolt two-point locking system, and with the option to choose your hardware you can even have an electronic keypad lock installed with the door! Research shows that a coded locking system deters burglars, who might otherwise look for hidden spare keys or take advantage of the vulnerable moment where you are fumbling to find your key before opening the door.</p><p>Beyond the lock itself, these screens are built to be both tough and smart security solutions. The Viewguard is equipped with MeshTec, the leader in security screening materials. MeshTec is a high-tensile stainless steel woven mesh, a USA made material that we offer with a life-time “never rust” warranty. Tensile systems help to ensure lasting durability. Tensile strength refers to the resistance of the material to breaking under tension. The more pressure and force applied to a MeshTec door screen, the tighter the screen locks into the frame. Picture a chinese finger trap toy, the harder you try to pull your fingers out, the tighter the toy becomes- the concept behind MeshTec technology is similar. MeshTec not only provides advanced security, the stainless steel mesh also lets in maximum airflow as compared with other security screening material.</p></div></div>",
      "<div class='col-md-12 text-center'><p>The Titan on the other hand comes standard with a perforated aluminum screening material, which offers an extra layer of privacy, and can stop potentially unwanted house guests from peering into your home. Both doors feature marine-grade aluminium frames, which are warrantied for 10 years, so that you can be sure your family is receiving a quality product.</p></div>",
      "<div class='col-md-12 text-center'><p>When Maria called Den Defenders on behalf of her mother, the customer service representative she talked to informed her about the showroom at our Sacramento location. After their experience at the big box store, Maria and Debra were thankful to be able to come see the front security screen door options in person, so they could determine if the products would actually be a good fit. Debra was instantly interested in the Viewguard, citing how surprised she was that the door was a security product, and noted that it really looks like just an upscale screen door. Do you remember the bars-on-the-windows, steel-trap, prison-like security products of yesterday? Debra certainly did, so she was shocked to see that Den Defenders was carrying such sleek, stylish products.</p></div>",
      "<div class='col-md-12 text-center'><p>Even though her mother loved the look of the Viewguard, Maria’s main concerns were still focused on the security features. Like Maria you might be thinking: How secure can these products really be? Can you cut the screen? Could an animal get through the screen? There are so many questions to consider when trying to protect your family! Luckily a trained customer service representative was there to explain that with modern, top of line products, like the Viewguard, you no longer need to sacrifice style for security. It would take a power saw to cut through the screen, so it will certainly stand up to any rottweiler or angry cat who tries to tear at it. Just in case there was any doubt left in their minds, the customer service representative pulled up this <a href='https://www.facebook.com/MikesMobileScreenAndChimneyService/videos/1264548423571761/'><u>video</u></a> for Maria and Debra, which shows a manufacturer attempting to kick in a Viewguard door. After the manufacturers kick the door over and over again, without even creating a dent, they escalate to taking a sledgehammer to the screen- and the door still is not compromised.</p></div>",
      "<div class='col-md-12 text-center'><p>Maria and Debra were convinced but still wanted to make sure the fit of the door would be correct, considering that after the big box store fiasco they knew Debra’s entryway was not a standard size. They were set up with a free measurement appointment for just a couple days after they came into the showroom. When the Den Defenders technician arrived they expected another “general contractor type” who would come take measurements and then quickly leave. They were, however, surprised again by the professional quality of Den Defenders' service. When they answered the door, Tyler gave them a warm and friendly greeting. As he got to work he explained to them his measuring process, so that they could better understand how the door would be mounted and how it would fit over Debra’s existing wood front door. He answered all of their questions and took time after measuring to make sure they knew all of their options. He even came prepared with swatches of the framing materials in various color samples, so that Maria and Debra could determine which color would maximize the curb appeal of the home.</p></div>",
      "<div class='col-md-12 text-center'><p>Ultimately Debra decided on the Viewguard door in Anodized Bronze. She was sold by the simple, classic design of the door, which she felt would add greatly to her home’s aesthetic appeal. Her daughter, Maria, was relieved by the fact that she no longer has to worry as much about her mother’s safety The heavy-duty stainless steel, aluminum frame, deadbolt lock, and hidden hardware all mean that her mother can let in the California cross breeze, even at night while she is sleeping, all while the home is more secure than ever! </p></div>",
      "<div class='row justify-content-around'><div class='col-md-5 text-center'><p>Only four weeks after Tyler first came out and met Maria and Debra for their measurement appointment, he came back to install their custom ordered door, so that he could personally ensure both women were satisfied with the fit, function, and design of the final product. Because Tyler was already familiar with their home and entryway the installation process was simple and seamless. Maria was so surprised by the quality of work that she swore never to settle for a company that uses random general contractors as installers ever again. </p></div><div class='col-md-5 text-center'><img src='/assets/images/blogposts/03-20/titanTechInstall.png' class='blog-img-fill'></div></div>",

It becomes more and more important everyday to take steps to protect yourself and your loved ones. Security products, especially on vulnerable entry points like front doors and windows, can help to fortify your home and guard you against unwanted visitors or threats to your family’s safety. One of the biggest concerns with a heavy-duty security product is that it might compromise the look of your home or come at the cost of your home’s curb appeal. With Den Defenders’s top of the line, custom-fitted security screen doors you’ll never have to worry about sacrificing style for security ever again. Advanced stainless steel Meshtec screening material and marine grade aluminum allow us to offer unparalleled warranties- so your home is guaranteed to stay protected and safe. With color and design options ranging from simple and classic to decorative and bold, we can ensure that you’ll find a door that not only protects your home, but also enhances and elevates the look of it.</p></div></div>",

Shortly after Debra’s Viewguard was installed, her close friend Kathy came to visit and instantly noticed the new security screen. She cited how she’d been looking for a similar product but since she lives in an independent housing retirement community she wasn’t sure where to start. Debra happily passed along a business card that Tyler had left with her when he finished her installation and thus another Den Defenders customer was born. Before the end of the summer season four more senior citizens in Kathy’s living community were serviced by Den Defenders. Kathy herself went forward with a Titan door in the “Folkstone” design and loves the character it adds to what she had previously considered a cookie cutter retirement home. The whole community seems to sleep a little safer and cooler thanks to the Den Defenders team.</p></div></div>",

      "We are very proud to call John Cummings a friend of Den Defenders Screen & Chimney Service. Mr. Cummings, and his foundation, was recently featured in the Stockton Record Newspaper. He is currently in the process of making his foundation an official non-profit organization. Below is the entire article.<br> <br> By Lori Gilbert<br> Record Staff Writer<br> Posted Nov. 8, 2014 @ 6:30 pm<br> <br> John Cummings was chopping and splitting the walnut trees he’d taken out of his two-acre property east of Stockton wondering what to do with all the wood when inspiration struck.<br> <br> Cummings, 64, born and raised in Linden, prefers burning eucalyptus and other hard woods because walnut burns faster and doesn’t radiate as much heat.<br> <br> When he’s sitting and enjoying the fire in his wood-burning stove — the only source of heat in the home built in 1929 that he shares with his wife — he doesn’t like to keep stoking it.<br> <br> People in need might not mind tending a fire more frequently, he reasoned, and his idea for a charitable organization was born.<br> <br> Warm a Hearth — Warm a Heart Foundation is not an official nonprofit yet. All of that takes time. There’s paperwork to be completed. Cummings, a mechanic by trade who owns his own business and serves local farmers, is putting the majority of his effort into his cause.<br> <br> Specifically, he wants to help low-income families stay warm during the winter. Warm a Hearth — Warm a Heart will pay for licensed chimney inspections and provide free firewood for those identified as being in need.<br> <br> “I wanted to do something to keep children warm,” Cummings said, “to keep them warm in a nice, safe environment.”<br> <br> If they’re safe and warm at night, he figures, they have a better chance of doing well in school and in life.<br> <br> Cummings, by his own definition a private man, is stepping out into the public for a cause. His heart seems to be in the right place, although his idea is not universally embraced.<br> <br> Wood burning is largely discouraged by the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District. The number of allowable burn days is expected to be smaller than in recent years in an effort to reduce particulate matter in the air.<br> <br> The district encourages residents to take advantage of its financial assistance to replace open wood-burning fireplaces with more efficient gas or pellet stoves.<br> <br> Even with assistance, though, modern stoves are not always feasible for families on tight budgets. In cases where fireplaces offer a home’s only source of heat, burn rules don’t apply.<br> <br> Farmington Fire Chief Conni Bailey is among those who are backing Cummings’ effort.<br> <br> “Anything we can do to support John in his efforts to keep kids warm, we’re all for,” said Bailey, whose mostly volunteer department is involved in several charitable efforts. “The inspections are a great boost to our end. We offered to assist in any way we could in that effort. He’s going to make available to us all those records. If something does happen, we’ll have records to go with our fire reports if there’s a chimney fire. We’ll know if it had been inspected.”<br> <br> Her department sees two to four chimney fires a year, she said.<br> <br> Beyond that, though, Bailey likes Cumming’s outreach to community members in need, something that defines her own fire department.<br> <br> Cummings is limiting his services to families with children in the Linden and Escalon school districts, the two areas where he lives and works.<br> <br> One farmer has donated 50 cords of wood. Others have made smaller donations. Running out of wood isn’t a concern for Cummings, who sees orchards pulled all the time. The bigger hurdle is connecting with families that can use his service.<br> <br> Cummings said he’s approached school district offices and schools with information to pass along to families who could use his help, but said he has gotten little response. The best connection he’s made was with an Escalon High School student he met at a gym where both work out. The young man is taking Cummings’ proposal to a service club he belongs to at school.<br> <br> Cummings also is spreading the word at local churches.<br> <br> Ultimately, he’d like to see volunteers join him in cutting and delivering wood, and keeping records of the work being done. His sister set up a website, warmahearthwarmaheart.webs.com, to accept donations to help with the costs of inspections.<br> <br> In the meantime, Cummings is using money he had planned to use to work on an old jeep to pay for the initial paperwork needed to start a foundation, and will also pay for chimney inspections. Real fund raising will have to be addressed in the future. For now, Cummings is more concerned with getting the program established.<br> <br> “This is the biggest thing I’ve done,” Cummings said. “I want to do something right.”<br> <br> Launched in the last couple months, Warm a Hearth – Warm a Heart is already has met its goal, Cummings said.<br> <br> “I’m already helping one person. A woman called,” Cummings said.<br> <br> That’s what he hoped for, to help even one person stay warm this winter. He dreams of more to come.<br> <br> Contact reporter Lori Gilbert at (209) 546-8284 or lgilbert@recordnet.com. Follow her on Twitter @lorigrecord."

One of the challenges OMG Wraps was having was finding a way to mount this door to the inside versus the outside of a doorway. No problem!<br><br> For the front OMG Wraps went with a custom Dakota designed door. The black frame color with a red perforated steel mesh offers contrast that makes this door stand out. This door offers an all steel, surface mount, pre-hung frame. Nice choice guys!<br><br> The other door they picked out is our bestselling door. The Viewguard Security Screen Door by R. Lang is a lightweight aluminum security door that can withstand a beating! Check out the Viewguard page on our website for more information. The Viewguard comes standard in white and bronze, but if you’re looking for a custom color please don’t hesitate to ask about it. We can definitely get you what you want.<br><br> Check out OMG Wraps here for any vehicle vinyl wrap jobs you need and go like them on Facebook <br><br> They do amazing work and we are happy to have them as customers.<br><br>"

Check out the Sliding Security Doors here(link).<br><br> Robert went a step further to customize his slider security doors. He decided to swamp out the regular screen for Beige 80% Solar Screen. Solar Screen offers added privacy. During the day it is harder to see into the home from the outside while still being able to see outside from inside the home. Did you know that Solar Screen is also pet resistant? A common trick is to get Solar Screen on your regular sliding door to prevent future damage from pets!"

      "Our featured customer this week is Andrea from Patterson California. Congratulations on your new Viewguard! Her Viewguard install has some custom features that might interest a potential customer.<br><br> The first issue was the handle side. Usually the handles of the existing wood door and Viewguard are on the same side, but as you can see in the pictures that wouldn't work great here. We changed the location of the handle set and saved her a lot of space. Andrea has small children so it was important for her to have safety in mind. We were able to mount the deadbolt higher than usual to keep her children from possibly opening the door. The last issue was solved by adding a pneumatic door closer. This will ensure that the door closes automatically, even when the family is in a rush. Her family's safety was at the top of her list and we were able to add some custom features to make this door work.<br><br> Congratulations on the new Viewguard again!

      "The simple answer is that Solar Screens stop the sun’s rays before they ever have a chance to reach your window. In contrast, window tint goes on the inside of the window, actually working against nicer insulated windows (some window tinting can actually void warranties on dual or triple paned windows due to the overheating possibilities). The same goes for all blinds and interior window coverings. Your window will still heat up and radiant heat will still heat up your home. Solar Screens work with your windows to keep the heat out and act as another insulation barrier making your home more efficient, more comfortable and saving you money. Den Defenders Screens offers the highest quality Solar Screen materials available that block 80-90% of the sun’s UV rays."

This will prevent chimney fires as well as maintain your fireplace/chimney safe to burn in. The NFPA suggests that you get your chimney swept after each cord of wood that you burn and/or an annual safety inspection.<br><br> One way a chimney inspection can be beneficial is to find water intrusion. If your chimney, cap or flashing is not properly installed and sealed it can lead to a bigger mess. Water can get into cracks a spread. If water freezes, it will expand and further damage an area. If your flashing is not properly installed and sealed it can lead to severe damage on your roof. This can trickle down (excuse the pun!) and cause leaking. Take a look at the pictures to see what water can cause. There will be more articles about this to come! Stay tuned."

      "Why Do I Need a Fireplace Grate<br><br> Let's start by describing what a fireplace grate is. Shown left, a fireplace grate is the cast iron, or metal, stand that your fire wood sits on. Typically it is centered in your fireplace. If you are having smoking issues you will need to make sure the grate is pushed all the way to the back.<br><br> Getting the firewood off of the ground does a couple of importantly thing.<br><br> By raising the wood off of the floor of the fireplace, you are allowing the wood to be burned more efficiently. Air is able to get under the wood causing the fire to burn hotter. When this is achieved you are essentially using less fuel to heat your home, thus saving you money on firewood.<br><br> Another benefit of a grate is when your firewood is raised, the coals from burning wood drop to the ground. This allows the fire to burn from the bottom up and subsequently the wood gets completely burned. As the hot coals drop, the need to shift or move the wood is not there because the wood is held by the grate.<br><br> A fireplace grate protects the floor of your fireplace. Direct exposure to high temperatures will destroy the concrete ground. The grate slows down the destruction of the ground by lifting the fire instead of the ground getting direct heat.<br><br> Fireplace grates are a must when it comes to properly using your fireplace. They help burn a more efficient fire and protect the floor of your fireplace from needing to be repair frequently."

      "If you're wanting to save money, (via saving energy) an energy saving top mounted damper is something you should take a look at. A traditional damper is metal and closes inside of your firebox. Is yours open or closed? If its shut, often times it doesn't seal. This presents a problem when running your air conditioning or heater. Air from inside the house that you want, (i.e. cool air or warm air) will end up leaving your house through the chimney. Would you leave a window open while your air conditioner/heater was on?<br><br> Lock Top II Dampers are mounted on top of you chimney and offer an air tight seal. This means that you won't have to worry when you use your air conditioning and heater. Closing a chimney from the top will end the days of having cold air trapped in your chimney. The cold air can cause smoking issues, inside of the house, because of a cold chimney."

      "Most homeowners want to know if the work they will have done to their home “meets code.” This is a tricky question with many answers and many prerequisites that need to be addressed before you answer. Codes are an ever-changing thing. They are written by large national organizations made up by government, and industry officials. The question “Does it meet code” depends on many factors and isn’t a clear yes or no.<br><br> Understanding Codes<br><br> Codes are a moving object. By that I mean that they are always changing. In fact, codes are changed, adjusted and made about every 3 years. They get changed because we want to improve upon them as well as make structures safer. An indirect result of these changes is the ability to understand how things hold up or deteriorate.<br><br> Does it meet code?<br><br> The answer to this question depends on when, who and where you ask. Something that meets code perfectly today might not meet code tomorrow. Houses that were built a short while ago could have been perfectly built to meet code, but today they do not. You could also build the same house in two different states or even cities, and one may not pass<br><br> Inconsistent Code<br><br> As with a lot of things, codes start at the Federal level and trickle down the bureaucratic ladder. State, county, city and municipality codes are enough to make a person scream. Who’s got time to research all of this?<br><br> The Code Police<br><br> Private home inspectors have no authority to enforce the building code. The municipal inspectors are the only people who can determine whether or not something meets code. And since they are people, even that can vary.<br><br> Grandfathered Code<br><br> The word ‘grandfather’ does not appear in the building codes. What?! Yes, Grand fathered in doesn’t mean anything since building codes are for new buildings only. Codes aren’t retroactive. In conclusion, safety takes precedent over all things when doing construction. Things that are unsafe are more important than minor changes over the years that don’t present a danger."

      "There are 3 Levels to chimney inspections. Den Defenders includes a Level I inspection with every chimney sweep. Here is a breakdown so you can see what happens during each type of inspection.<br><br> Level One Chimney Inspection<br><br> If your chimney performance, appliance or venting system has not changed and you simply want to be confident in the continued safe use of the system, you will need the Level 1 inspection done on an annual schedule. We usually combine this service with the annual cleaning and sweeping that should be scheduled to guarantee continued safe use of your stove, chimney or furnace.<br><br> Our chimney inspection tech will examine the readily accessible portions of the interior and exterior areas of the chimney and the appliance or chimney connection. This includes the firebox, smoke chamber and damper along with the cap and crown on the exterior of your chimney if accessed with cleaning. We will be looking for any chimney structure or flue defect or underperforming areas with the appliance installation or connections. The whole system must be found to be clear of any blockage or deposits that may be combustible.<br><br> Level Two Chimney Inspection<br><br> A Level 2 inspection is recommended when you have had any changes done to your system. If you have changed fuel type, or had the chimney relined, if you have replaced your furnace or appliance (especially if the rating or efficiency differs from what was there prior). If you recently bought the home and are not familiar with the system performance, plan to do modifications to your chimney, stove or heating system or have had a chimney fire recently a Level 2 inspection is in order.<br><br> A Level 2 inspection is an in-depth look at the entire chimney, stove or furnace system. It includes all steps covered with a Level 1 inspection and also includes a visual inspection of all internal surfaces and joints. If necessary, we use a color video inspection camera to look inside the chimney or flue. This allows for a complete top to bottom visual inspection of your system. A written report is produced that details all areas that may be of concern.<br><br> Level Three Chimney Inspection<br><br> Level 1 and 2 methods are included with Level 3 inspections, but with this type inspection portions of the structure or chimney will be required to fully investigate the deficiencies that exist. Many areas that are concealed from visual examination may need to be opened up by removing bricks, masonry, metal flue pipes, interior chimney walls, chimney crowns or other components of your system. <br><br>These inspections are only required when the earlier inspection Level 1 or 2 reveals a serious problem and we need to gain access to the problem areas hidden from view. Level 3 inspections are needed on less than 2% of all inspections when serious problems are suspected that require immediate action."

Lint from textiles (clothes) is extremely flammable.<br><br> Not only is a clean dryer vent more safe, it's also more efficient. A dryer vent clogged with lint reduces airflow so your dryer doesn't dry as efficiently as it used to.

Exterior masonry chimneys collect moisture when not in use (GREAT reason to have a chimney cap!) and are often much colder than the rest of your house when starting a fire. If fireplace gasses cool off before the smoke exits the chimney, a draft is going to be weak or non-existent. It is important to get a good draft and a strong fire going right away. If this is an issues you are having you will notice that starting fires gets easier the more often you use your chimney since it dries out throughout the season."

      "After you burn a fire the wood will eventually cool down. When it cools down, you create creosote. Creosote is a liquid that gets attached (or condenses) to the inner wall of your flue or connector pipe. The creosote will dry out and become hard and become one of 3 stages. Stage 1 (velvet soot), Stage 2 porous and crunchy in makeup or Stage 3, shiny, rock-hard chimney glaze. The more fires you have, the more makeup you are creating.<br><br> If this happens to your chimney you will need to have a De-glazing done. This is a two steps process. Den Defenders uses a product called ACS (Anti Creosote Spray). We recommend that our affected customers make a few fires over the course of a few weeks and spray this the ACS into their fire. ACS changes the chemical buildup of the creosote and weakens it. We can then come out to your home and clean your chimney."

      "Chimney fires are usually caused by the accumulation of creosote in the chimney. Creosote is a natural by-product of burning wood. It accumulates in the flue over time and is highly flammable. Creosote is especially likely to accumulate when wood is not burned at the proper temperature. Since creosote is flammable, when it accumulates on the walls of your flue, hot flue gasses can ignite it. The result is a chimney fire. Depending on the condition of your chimney, such a fire can pose a significant threat to the rest of your house. Flames from the fire can find their way through cracks in your clay chimney liner or mortar and ignite framing around the chimney. They can also spill over onto the roof and cause a fire there."

The damper is a lever meant to seal your fireplace when not in use. This is so heated air from your home will not escape up the chimney. An open or broken damper can add substantial costs to your heating bill each year.<br><br> How Does a Damper Work?<br><br> Most dampers have a metal to metal seal which isn't ideal. Even when new this can cause air to leak through. As the fireplace gets used, the metal plates warp from the effects of heat and moisture.

      "A natural draft gas fireplace DOES NOT HAVE a sealed chamber (where combustion takes place). Instead, it relies on the buoyancy of hot gases to vent. It is important for these vent applications to be installed with an existing chimney that meets local building code or by using a B vent. A  B vent is a pipe that is installed using the same procedures of a masonry chimney but can be enclosed in a combustible material. Since the flue gases are hot and rise naturally, oxygen needed for combustion draws easily from the surrounding area of the fireplace. This creates a simple route for the gases to go up through the chimney. In turn, as the fireplace is used and the hot gases travel upwards, the walls of the chimney heat up, and retain their temperature and buoyancy, creating a faster speed with which the flue gases exit the chimney."

      "Let's define what a lining system is first. Masonry chimneys have an inner liner of clay flue tiles. The liner keeps the heat of flue gases inside the chimney. Now the chimney can't overheat the nearby combustibles, such as the framing and walls of your house, and possibly start a fire. The liner is also important because it keeps carbon monoxide, moisture, smoke, creosote, and other products of combustion from leaking through the bricks and mortar of your chimney and additionally into your home.<br><br> Let's talk about Relining. It's Simple. If a liner was never installed or there are problems with the current liner (tile lining cracks, crumbles or has deteriorates over time). Often times water damage, chimney fires, or just age can cause the deterioration of your clay liner. National Fire Prevention Association (NFPA) code 211 says it must be replaced. The most popular, effective and economical way to reline your chimney is with UL listed, stainless steel relining pipe. As you can see, a secure lining system is crucial to the safety and well being of your home and family."

      "Sunesta awnings are not only easy to operate, they're also easy to maintain. To start with, the location of your awning determines the frequency we recommend cleaning it. If your home is located inland, you should clean your awning twice a year. If you are on or near the ocean, you should clean your awning once a month due to the salt exposure. To clean your awning, spray off loose debris and dirt with a water hose. For bird droppings and other attached residue, use warm water and a soft bristled scrub brush on the spot requiring attention before rinsing with your hose. After you have removed any loose dirt and/or residue, allow your awning to dry completely before coating with a rain repellent such as Scotch Guard. If your awning fabric has tougher stains such as mildew, you can attempt to remove the stains with a mild soap, such as Ivory Snow or Woolite, with warm water and a soft bristled scrub brush. Avoid using any product with the word 'detergent' in it. Again, only use a mild soap. After using the soap, rinse the awning thoroughly with water from your hose. Allow the awning to dry completely before coating the fabric with a rain repellent as mentioned previously. Proper care for the frame of your awning includes rinsing it with water from your hose, wiping it down with a soft cloth and using a 100 percent silicone lubricant on all moving parts of the lateral awning. Again, the lubricant must be 100 percent silicone. Avoid using lubricants such as WD-40 as they will leave a residue and may stain your awning's fabric. By following these simple recommendations, you will extend the life of your awning and your enjoyment of it. For any additional questions about the proper care and cleaning of your Sunesta awning, please contact Sunesta's customer service department at 800.874.2001."

In addition to the Sunesta models and parts being tested, our facility is inspected by TÜV every year (a certificate of this inspection is available upon request). The inspection is necessary to ensure that we are using the parts that were actually approved. There is another organization associated with retractable awning ratings called CE. This organization does not perform any testing or inspections, it just creates guidelines (wind classes) for rating retractable awnings. Awning manufacturers are then left to voluntarily determine which wind class rating applies to their products without any independent testing and confirmation."

      "A 2007 study conducted by the Center for Sustainable Building Research, at the University of Minnesota, concluded that awnings can save homeowners up to 25 percent on energy costs. The reason? Because awnings result in cooling energy savings by 'reducing direct solar gain through windows' In addition, according to the Department of Energy publication, Cooling Your Home, awnings block up to 90 percent of solar heat that is absorbed through windows."

      "According to the Professional Awning Manufacturers Association, a retractable or lateral arm awning is entirely supported from a building and constructed so that the awning cover and supporting frame retract completely against the building's exterior wall. In a retracted position the awning is relieved from wind, rain and snow pressure normally associated with fixed frame awnings. Retractable awnings are commonly used to shade large outdoor areas, such as a deck or patio, and are operated using either a manual crank or remote-controlled motor to extend or retract the awning. Check out our Retractable Awnings."

We want screens to fit perfectly and this usually means measuring everything to the 1/16th of an inch. If we make a mistake out in the field we can easily correct it. This allows us to confidently build screens to fit your home. This is essential when it comes to installing solar screens. Other companies make screens inches larger than necessary so they don’t accidentally make one too small (and cause them another trip out). Unfortunately, when installing a solar screen that isn't a perfect fit there is a high possibility of water intrusion problems down the road. When it comes to window screens, ones built on-site are always better. Also whenever someone is doing work on your home be sure to check their insurance, GL, worker’s compensation and contractor’s license and bond."

At Den Defenders Screens & Chimney Service our steel doors are 100% custom and made to fit your home. We build our doors in a, far superior, 1 piece design for added strength and beauty. We have over 10 different mounting styles so no matter what kind of existing door frame you have we can build something to fit perfectly. We also build every steel door to stop the bugs from coming in, as well as unwanted people. We have built in flanges that cover all the gaps (as well as adding more security) and can put a door sweep on the bottom to complete the installation."

      "Those long hot summer days are finally here and so are the annoying bugs that come with them. Here are some quick tips how to keep those pesky bugs away from your screens: Clean Your Screens Debris is constantly flying through the air and getting caught in your window screens. This collection of small particles can attract several types of bugs causing them to hang out onto your screens. Simply remove your window screens and wash them with a mild soap and water. This is a great time to wash your windows also. Not feeling up to it? Give us a call and we can wash your windows inside and out! Be sure to let the screens dry before re-installing to avoid spotting your windows. Household Repellents If washing the screens doesn't seem to help you there are some simple repellents you might find around the home that can be used to deter bugs. A little bit of peppermint oil on your screens usually works. It can be applied easily using a paper towel. Vinegar works well as a second choice. Ammonia works great as a cat and small animal repellent. Citronella Citronella is a popular bug repellent and comes in an oil form or in candles. You can often find it at outdoor stores near camping equipment. Now you can enjoy your summer breezes without unsightly bugs crawling all over your screens!"

This blog is to tell you all about the process and explain everything. City Inspections: Den Defenders has a California State Contractor's License with the CSLB. Our technicians will easily navigate through this process and get a Permit for your home and the work to be done. City Inspectors come to inspect the work at key points in the Demolition/Construction. Once the work is complete there will be a final inspection. At this time the city will remove the color coded tag from you door. Yellow Tag A yellow tag means “cautionary.” Property owners can access and clean their buildings, and once clean can contact the City for re-inspection. Call 707-258-7829 to request a re-inspection. Red Tag A red tag means the building structure has been damaged and is not safe to enter. Please do not enter your building. You must hire a qualified, licensed engineer to inspect the property and prepare a written assessment. The City will post a list of qualified engineers from the region on its website at www.cityofnapa.org, or you may already have one to work with. Submit the assessment report to the City’s Building Department at 1600 First Street, beginning Tuesday, August 26th. If the report indicates the building is safe to access and occupy, the City will upgrade the red tag to a yellow tag, and then you must follow the steps described above for a yellow tag. If the report indicates the building is not safe to access and occupy, the report will include recommendations for structural modifications. The Building Division will work with the owner on the best course of action."
